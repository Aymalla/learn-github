## Workflows

Explore the workflow features of GitHub Actions to automate the build and release process. we will create two workflows:

- [x] Build Workflow: Triggered on pull request to the main branch and on push to the main branch.

- [x] Which versions of the workflows are triggered on different events.
- [x] Triggering events for the workflows.
- [x] Conditional execution of the workflows based on the event type.
- [x] Access secrets and environment variables in the workflows.
- [x] Use of reusable action.
- [x] Use of reusable workflows.

## Caching 

Explore the caching features of GitHub Actions to speed up the build process. we will create a cache for the build artifacts and dependencies.
